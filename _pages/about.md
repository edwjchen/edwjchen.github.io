Hi, **I'm Edward!** I'm a PhD student studying computer systems and security at Carnegie Mellon University co-advised by <a href="https://wzheng.github.io/" target="_blank">Wenting Zheng</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mlfbrown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a>. My primary research is on building secure and optimized systems for various cryptographic protocols.
